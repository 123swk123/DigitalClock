Welcome to C++ Digital Clock for AVRs

This open source project aims at developing Digital Clock using C++ language for AVR controllers and taking the advantage C++ language to support different types of user inputs, outputs and variuous types of RTC chips.

currently planned inputs

1. UART
2. IR remote
3. Key pad - 3 button

and outputs

1. 7-Segment LEDs (4 digits - 1/4")
2. Alpha numeric LEDs (4 digits)
3. 2x16 Char LCD

finally RTC

I. TCXO based internal 32kHz crystal
  1. DS3231
  2. RX8025
  
II. External 32kHz crystal
  1. DS1307
